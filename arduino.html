topIntroText: "Arduino is a convenient, flexible and easy-to-use open source electronic programming development platform. The Arduino can sense the environment through a variety of sensors and feedback and influence the environment by controlling lights, motors and other devices. The microcontroller on the board can program through Arduino's programming language. Through hands-on operation of software and hardware, it can quickly make automatic alarm devices, smart irrigation systems and other professional projects."
